# Single

Single is program lang for effect.
Single is programming language for effect.
Single is Effect Class.
Single is effect class.

Single is used to make module for effect.
Single is used to make module that has effect class.

Single is object oriented.
Single is class based.

Single source item root node is Class node.

Single has all Class Lang lang element nodes.
Single lang elements has same syntax as Class Lang lang elements.

Single has Sand inner processing element.

Single module source has port.
The port is same as in Class Lang module source port.

Single output and input of lang elements has class, same as Class Lang.

Single builtin Int is 60 bits, same as Class Lang.
Builtin Int value is stored in ref holder ref value.
Builtin Bool value is stored in ref holder ref value.
Ref is 64 bits, same as Class Lang.

Single builtin String value uses 32 bits int as char unit.

Single has class checking, name checking and count checking that is same as Class Lang.

Single memory management is manual memory management.
Single NewOperate and ShareOperate have memory allocation.
The memory allocation does not have auto delete.

Single has DeleteExecute.
DeleteExecute is execute that delete any.
The execute has syntax that starts with "delete" index word, 
followed by Any of class Operate, followed by limit semicolon.
Any operate has class that is Any class.
The execute deletes the any refered by the ref value of Any operate.
After the execute is executed, the any is deleted and does not exist.
If the any is Bool or Int, the execute has no effect.

Using any comp on any ref that refers to any that does not exist is a programming error.

Single CastOperate is same as Class Lang.
If the operate casts to class that is not value class and not Any class and 
the input of the operate refers to any that does not exist, 
the operate is a programming error.

Single System.Infra module Any class has 1 maide.
The maide name is "Final".
The maide count is prusate.
The maide result class is Bool.
The maide has no param var.
The maide finalizes the any.
The maide results Bool true.
After this maide is called, the any comps can not be used.

Calling Final maide on Bool or Int does nothing, only returns Bool true. 

Single System modules Bool and Int classes has no comp defined on them.

Single does not need shared comp.
Single has ShareOperate that results shared instance.
This is enough element to do any share.

Single does not need struct.
Single has System modules that have classes.
The classes do no have struct in their abstracts.
This is enough element to do any inner processing.

Single does not need enum.
Single has class and share operate.
This is enough element to do any shared list for system programming.

Single does not need delegate.
Single has get, set and call that are virtual.
Get, set, and call are triggered on any.
This is enough element to do any ref call.

Single any allocate is most general.
Single allocate any with NewOperate and ShareOperate.
The allocate is not tagged with the existence of specific class of any.
Stack allocate any will tag the allocate with the existence of specific class as the size of the any will tag.

Single does not need operator overloading.
Single has comp name, same as Class Lang.
This is enough element to do any trigger.
This is enough element to do any comp.

Single does not need generic.
Single class has base class, same as Class Lang.
Single has CastOperate.
This is enough element to do any class basing.

Single Lang does not need lang element to interface to external.
Single compiler modules have infra to generate refer binary.
The refer binary can refer to custom made machine code binary.
This is enough element to interface to external.

Single compiler does not optimize output.
This is enough element to do any process system module making.
