# Single

Single is effect program lang.
Single is effect programming language.
Single is Effect Class.
Single is effect class.

Single is effect purpose program lang.
Single is effect mark program lang.

Single is used to make module for effect.
Single is used to make module that has effect class.
Single is used to make abstract for effect.

Single is used to make effect plat.

Single is not enough general to make model.
Single New allocated ClassType any need to be deleted,
when the module need to continue execution.

Single is not enough general to make model package.

Single is object oriented.
Single is class base.

The word "Single" is this program lang node name.

Make module with Single has develop execute certain.

Single is effecon in make module for effect.

Single source item root node is Class node.

Single has all Class Lang lang element nodes.

Single has Sand inner processing element.

Single module source has port.
The port is same as in Class Lang module source port.

Single has type checking, name checking and count checking.

Single has Type.
Type is ClassType, IntType orn StructType.

Single output and input of lang elements has Type.

Single builtin Int is 60 bits, same as Class Lang.
Builtin Int value is stored in ref holder ref value.
Builtin Bool value is stored in ref holder ref value.
Builtin IntType is 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits orn 64 bits.
Builtin IntType value is stored in ref holder ref value.
Ref is 64 bits, same as Class Lang.

Single builtin String value uses 32 bits int as char unit.
Builtin String is ClassType.

Operate results ref.
Mark inputs ref.

Single memory management is manual memory management.
Single NewOperate and ShareOperate have memory allocation.
The memory allocation does not have auto delete.

Single has DeleteExecute.
DeleteExecute is execute that delete any.
The execute has syntax that starts with "delete" index word, 
followed by Any of class Operate, followed by limit semicolon.
Any operate can be any type.
The execute deletes the any refered by the ref value of Any operate.
After the execute is executed, the any is deleted and does not exist.

Using any comp on any ref that refers to any that does not exist is a programming error.

Single Field and Maide can be glob comp.
Comp that has "glob" index word after Count index word is glob comp.

Single Class has Struct comp.

Single CastOperate is same as Class Lang.
If the operate casts to class that is not value class and not Any class and 
the input of the operate refers to any that does not exist, 
the operate is a programming error.

Single System.Infra module Any class has 1 maide.
The maide name is "Final".
The maide count is prusate.
The maide result class is Bool.
The maide has no param var.
The maide finalizes the any.
The maide results Bool true.
After this maide is called, the any comps can not be used.

Calling Final maide on Bool or Int does nothing, only returns Bool true. 

Single System modules Bool and Int classes has no comp defined on them.

GlobGetOperate is operate that trigg glob field get.
The operate has syntax that start with "glob" index word, follow by
Class of class ClassName, follow by limit dot token, follow by Field
of class FieldName.
Glob field with field name Field in class Class is trigg get.
The operate Type is result Type of the field.

GlobSetMark is mark that trigg glob field set.
The mark has syntax that is same as GlobGetOperate.
Glob field with field name Field in class Class is trigg set with Value
from AreExecute.

GlobCallOperate is operate that trigg glob maide call.
The operate has syntax that start with "glob" index word, follow by
Class of class ClassName, follow by limit dot token, follow by Maide
of class MaideName, follow by limit brace round open token, follow
by Argue of class Argue, follow by limit brace round close token.
Glob maide with maide name Maide in class Class is trigg call.

Single does not need enum.
Single has class and share operate.
This is enough element to do any shared list for effect programming.

Single does not need delegate.
Single has instant get, set and call that are virtual.
Instant get, set, and call are triggered on any.
Single has ref call operate that can call field get and set and maide.
This is enough element to do any ref call.

Single does not need maide overload.
Single has comp name, same as Class Lang.
This is enough element to do any comp with execute certain.

Single does not need operator overloading.
Single has comp name, same as Class Lang.
This is enough element to do any trigger.
This is enough element to do any comp.

Single does not need generic.
Single class has base class, same as Class Lang.
Single has CastOperate.
This is enough element to do any class basing.

Single Lang does not need lang element to interface to external.
Single compiler modules have infra to generat binary.
The generate can be specified to refer the module binary state to custom made machine code binary.
This is enough element to interface to external.

Single compiler does not optimize output.
This is enough element to do any process effect module making.
